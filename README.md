# Requirements
Python version 3.5 or higher
## Modules
The following modules are required to run these scripts (use ```pip3``` if on mac/linux, ```pip``` on windows):
 - pandas (```pip3 install pandas``` in terminal)
 - numpy (```pip3 install numpy``` in terminal)
 - matplotlib (```pip3 install matplotlib``` in terminal)
 - seaborn (```pip3 install seaborn``` in terminal)

If neither ```pip``` or ```pip3``` works, use ```python3 -m pip3``` (mac/linux) or ```python -m pip``` (windows). 
The jupyter notebooks have been converted to python scripts if you want to run them.
